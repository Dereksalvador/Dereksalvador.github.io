Hello, and welcome to my professional page! I’m Dr. Roderick Salvador, a veterinarian, epidemiologist, and educator with over 20 years of experience in veterinary science and public health. Currently, I serve as an Associate Professor at the College of Veterinary Science and Medicine at [Central Luzon State University](https://clsu.edu.ph/), where I’ve dedicated my career to advancing animal and public health through research, teaching, and community engagement.

My academic journey includes a PhD in Veterinary Science from [Chiang Mai University](https://www.cmu.ac.th/en/home), where I explored the spatial transmission of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, and an MPH in Epidemiology from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/). Broadly, my research interests are infectious disease epidemiology, zoonotic diseases, and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for disease mapping and surveillance. My research reflects my commitment to a One Health approach—bridging the gaps between human, animal, and environmental health.

As an educator, I’m passionate about mentoring future veterinarians and instilling a multidisciplinary perspective in my students. I teach courses ranging from General Veterinary Pathology to Zoonoses and Emerging Infectious Diseases, always emphasizing practical applications and global health challenges.

Outside the classroom and lab, I frequently collaborate with organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Bureau of Animal Industry, contributing to initiatives addressing diseases like African Swine Fever and avian influenza. My work has been recognized through awards such as the [Ford Foundation International Fellowship](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/investing-in-individuals/international-fellowships-program/) and the [CLSU Faculty Development Fellowship](https://clsu.edu.ph/news-and-updates/article/ovpaa-launches-dats-program-through-capacity-building-workshop-for-newly-hired-faculty).

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to explore my research, publications, and teaching contributions.
